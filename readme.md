A simple plugin that opens the Global Search via URI, currently just for personal use.



The current syntax: `playnite://search/`. Any extra arguments sent afterwards (`/search/args/like/this`) will for now simply be added as the search string `"args like this"`. 

Why? Because I personally use a different windows command palette (PowerToys Run) and don't want multiple hotkeys for similar things, so I can just open one in the other:
